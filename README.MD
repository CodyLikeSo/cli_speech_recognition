# Audio Recognizer

This project is a simple audio recognizer that can transcribe audio files in either English or Russian. It also allows you to adjust the volume and speed of the audio, and save the result as a new .wav file.

## Quick Use

1. Set up the virtual environment (if you prefer)
```
(.venv) >>> 
    1. !python -m venv .venv
    2. !source .venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install required libraries
```
pip install pydub DateTime speech_recognition
```
3. Download a .wav file from a website like [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) and take note of its path.
